Say that your company sells 3D printers for 2000€ each per month on average. If a new website could increase the visitor count by 20 or % percent and out of those visitors 5% would result in a sale. When would the money paid for this website be saved in sales? If the new website resulted in just 1 more sale per month, that would make a 2000€ website a great investment.

When a small company is thinking about getting a new website, it is understable that they would gear towards a cheap alternative. However, with a professionally made website you get website performance and SEO at a higher level that in turn will drive sales. 

Having a budget for adds on Google paired with a professional website will in most cases be worth the investment.
