      Should your website follow current design trends?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Certain trends in web-design have become so strong that many websites have
      started to look the same. This is in part fuelled by the use of styling
      frameworks such as Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, etc. Some people may find this
      dull, but it is also a great opportunity to get a website with a proven
      structure and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, should your website follow the current design trends, or should you
      aim for an original website design?

    <p>
      Do you produce a unique product or do your customers Google your name and
      know your product beforehand? Then you should definitely try to
      &quot;wow&quot; them with an original design. This will make their user
      experience memorable and increase their perception of your product and
      your brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most companies do not fit in this category and should therefore focus on:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Website performance (both loading time and SEO)</li>
      <li>Ease of use</li>
      <li>Short and precise texts</li>
      <li>Awesome images and video</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The strong design trends we see all emphasize those four elements, such as
      the use of vector images and animations that provides your website with a
      clean user-interface and a site that loads fast. We also see strong trends
      in the way a website is structured, i.e. in the hero section, the feature
      section, and contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some designers may find this dull, these trends provide the
      end-users with familiar fonts, colours, and site structure that allows
      them to navigate with ease and thereby improving their user-experience. In
      the end, it is user-experience that should guide design-decisions when
      building a website for a company.

      More Advantages of Following Design Trends
    </h3>
    <p>
      Besides high-performance, SEO and user-familiarity you can often get more
      for less. If you opt for using a design framework, the development of your
      website can be faster or cheaper because. This is because many of the
      design elements have already been decided by following the trend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fonts, colours, sizing, and text is what can make your website personal.
      It might still have a tendency to &quot;feel&quot; like other websites,
      which might not be a bad thing for your business.
    </p>
    <h3 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      In most cases, I believe that companies should opt for following the
      design trends when deciding on a new website. With so many different
      design frameworks available today you can still get a website that feels
      uniquely yours while looking familiar to the visitors.
